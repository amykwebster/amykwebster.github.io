          <p> Almost all organisms face fluctuations in food availability in the wild. The ability to survive periods of starvation is crucial for fitness in adverse environments. The nematode worm <i>C. elegans </i>can survive starvation - the complete absence of food - for weeks or months. However, worms differ in their ability to survive starvation. I am interested in understanding the factors that explain the differences in worms' ability to survive starvation, including both genetic and epigenetic factors. Some specific questions include: 1) What epigenetic mechanisms can explain how two genetically identical populations of worms survive starvation differently?; 2) what specific genes regulate the dramatic gene expression changes that occur during starvation?; and 3) what natural variation is important for starvation survival among wild populations of <i>C. elegans</i>? Ultimately, I aim to understand the interaction of these factors (i.e. natural genetic variation controlling epigenetic regulation) in shaping starvation survival.
      <h3>Transgenerational epigenetic effects of early-life starvation</h3>
      <p>We found worms that experience extended dauer diapause, an environmentally-induced developmental arrrest, produce great-grand progeny that exhibit increased starvation resistance as larvae and live longer as adults compared to genetically identical worms with unstarved ancestors. These worms also exhibit gene expression differences consistent with a small, genome-wide effect on the nutrient response.

      <h3>Regulation of gene expression during starvation</h3>
      <p><i>C. elegans</i> hatch as L1 larvae, and in the absence of food, they forgo development and remain arrested as L1 larvae. They can survive in L1 arrest for weeks before eventually dying of starvation. Although worms starved different lengths of time are in the same developmental stage, I have found that substantial changes to the transcriptional profiles of arrested L1s occur late in starvation. I am working to uncover regulators of these transcriptional changes that may be important for a worm's survival during L1 arrest. </p>

      <h3>Natural variation of starvation resistance</h3>
      <p>Within the  <i>C. elegans</i> species, many wild isolates have been collected and sequenced as part of <a href="https://elegansvariation.org/">CeNDR</a>. I am utilizing 100 wild isolates from this resource that represent the diversity of the species. Ultimately, I hope to uncover the genetic basis for the natural variation of starvation resistance across these wild isolates using statistical and quantitative genetics approaches. </p>
