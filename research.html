          <p> Almost all organisms face fluctuations in food availability in the wild. The ability to survive periods of starvation is crucial for fitness in adverse environments. The nematode worm <i>C. elegans </i>can survive starvation - the complete absence of food - for weeks or months. However, worms differ in their ability to survive starvation. I am interested in understanding the factors that explain the differences in worms' ability to survive starvation, including both genetic and epigenetic factors. Some specific questions include: 1) What epigenetic mechanisms can explain how two genetically identical populations of worms survive starvation differently?; 2) what specific genes regulate the dramatic gene expression changes that occur during starvation?; and 3) what natural variation is important for starvation survival among wild populations of <i>C. elegans</i>? Ultimately, I aim to understand the interaction of these factors (i.e. natural genetic variation controlling epigenetic regulation) in shaping starvation survival.
      <h3>Transgenerational epigenetic effects of early-life starvation</h3>
      <p>We found worms that experience extended dauer diapause, an environmentally-induced developmental arrrest, produce great-grand progeny that survive starvation better as larvae and live longer as adults compared to genetically identical worms with unstarved ancestors. These worms also exhibit gene expression differences consistent with a small, genome-wide effect on the nutrient response.
